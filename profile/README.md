# 🌟 Welcome to the Better Ecosystem! 🌟

Hi there! We're building the **Better Ecosystem**, a suite of applications that will include a new Desktop Environment (DE) for Linux distributions, tentatively called **betterTWM**. The entire ecosystem is designed with a focus on simplicity, efficiency, and a cohesive user experience. 🚀

## 🌱 Our Vision

The goal is to create a "better" Linux experience by developing a suite of applications that are:
- **Lightweight & Fast:** Optimized for performance.
- **Intuitive & User-Friendly:** Easy to learn and use.
- **Cohesive & Integrated:** Designed to work together seamlessly.
- **Modern & Aesthetically Pleasing:** A clean and beautiful interface.

## 🛠️ Core Projects

The Better Ecosystem will consist of several core applications, each housed in its own repository under this profile. Planned projects include:

*   `better-bar`: A sleek and customizable status bar.
*   `better-launcher`: An efficient application launcher.
*   `better-terminal`: A modern and powerful terminal emulator.
*   `better-files`: A simple yet effective file manager.
*   `better-settings`: A unified control panel for system settings.
*   `better-clock`: A minimalist and functional clock application.
*   `better-notifications`: A non-intrusive notification system.
*   ...and more to come!

Each project will follow the `better-*` naming convention.

## 🗺️ Roadmap & Current Status

The Better Ecosystem is currently in the early stages of planning and development. Stay tuned for updates as individual projects kick off!
